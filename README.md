# Wheel Event handling with TSX and Alpine.js

As part of tutorials about alpine.js and JSX/TSX, this project teaches you how to handle the wheel event in the alpine.js way. This project displays an input tag where the value is numeric. By scrolling up/down your mouse/trackpad, the counter value will increment or decrement.
